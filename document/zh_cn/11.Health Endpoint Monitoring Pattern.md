对于一个应用程序，可以使用外部工具通过其暴露在外的终端来对其内部进行定期的功能检查。本模式可以帮助用户验证应用程序是否正确运行。

## 现状及难题
对Web应用、中间件以及共享服务实施监控通常是一个良好的实践，也是一个商业刚需，这可以保证它们是可用的并且正确运行。然而，监控一个运行在云上的应用比监控一个本地应用麻烦一点。举个例子，比如你无法拥有托管环境的完全控制权，再如你的服务一般依赖于其他平台供应商提供或者第三方服务。

也有许多其他因素影响着云托管应用程序，比如网络延迟、底层运算和存储系统的性能及可用性和它们之间的网络带宽。你的服务也许会因为上述原因而或多或少出现失败。因此，你必须定时确认服务正在正确运行，并保证其运行可用性的需求水平——这可能是白纸黑字写入你的服务级别协议（SLA）中的。

## 解决方案
可以通过向一个应用程序终端发送请求来实施健康监控。应用程序应该执行必要的检查，并返回其状态的指示。

一个健康监控检查通常需要结合2个因素：一是因健康验证终端的请求而在应用程序或服务上执行的检查，二是对工具或框架上执行的健康验证检查的结果的分析。响应代码显示了应用程序的状态，并且有时候，也显示它使用的组件和服务。网络延迟或者响应时间是通过健康工具或者框架来执行的。图1显示了这种模式的实施概览。

图1 - 健康端点监控模式概览

可能通过应用程序本身的健康监控代码执行的检查包括：
* 检查云存储或者数据库的可用性及响应时间。
* 检查其他资源，或者那些位于应用程序内部或位于其他地方但是被应用程序使用的服务。

当前已经有了一些现成的服务和工具可以用来监控web程序，它们通过往配置列表中的终端提交请求并依据配置规则来作出结果评估。在系统中创建一个单纯为了执行一些功能测试的服务终端是相对容易的。

可以通过监控工具来执行的典型检查包括：
* 验证响应代码。举个例子，一个200（OK）的HTTP响应代码表示应用程序没有发生错误。为了给出更加全面的结果，监控系统可能需要对其他响应代码作出检查。
* 即使返回了一个200（OK）状态码，通过检查响应内容来发现错误。这可以检查返回的网页或者服务响应中的特定的一部分内容。举个例子，可以检查页面标题或去匹配一个用来表示正确页面的短语。
* 测算响应时间，这个时间显示了网络延迟和应用程序用来执行请求的时间总和。如果这个值正在上升，那么这也许意味着应用程序或者网络可能出现了一个新问题。
* 检查那些应用程序之外的资源或者服务，比如应用程序用从全局缓存中来分发内容的内容分发网络（CDN）。
* 检查SSL证书的到期时间。
* 测算DNS寻找应用程序URL的响应时间，这可以用来检测DNS延迟和DNS错误。
* 验证由DNS返回的URL来保证正确的入口。这可以用来避免在DNS服务器上已经成功实施的恶意请求重定向攻击。

对不同的本地或者托管的位置来执行这些检查来检测和比较不同地方的响应时间，这往往是十分有用和可行的。理想情况下，你应该监控那些离客户距离近的应用程序结点，以此来准确地获得每个地点的性能。此外，为了提供一个更加健壮的检查机制，这些结果可能会影响应用程序部署地点的选择——以及是否需要在多个数据中心部署。

测试也应该在所有用户使用的服务实例上运行，这可以保证应用程序对于所有用户正正确地运行。举个例子，如果用户存储分散在多个存储帐号中，监控过程应该检查所有的帐号。

## 问题及注意事项
在决定如何去实施这种模式时需要考虑一下几点：

* 如何验证响应。举个例子，单单一个200（OK）的状态码是否足够表明应用程序正在正确运行？即使这个状态码提供了这种模式的可用性的最基础的度量标准，然而它几乎不会关于提供应用程序的操作、趋向和可能出现的问题。

**请注意:**
> 请保证应用程序只有在目标资源被找到或者被处理以后才返回200状态码。在一些场景中，比如使用一个主页面去请求一个目标页面，即使这个目标页面未找到，服务器端可能返回一个200 OK的状态码而不是404未找到代码。

* The number of endpoints to expose for an application. One approach is to expose at least one endpoint for the core services the application uses and another for ancillary or lower priority services, allowing different levels of importance to be assigned to each monitoring result. Also consider exposing more endpoints, such as one for each core service, to provide additional monitoring granularity. For example, a health verification check might check the database, storage, and an external geocoding service an application uses; each requiring a different level of uptime and response time. The application may still be healthy if the geocoding service, or some other background task, is unavailable for a few minutes.
* Whether to use the same endpoint for monitoring as is used for general access, but to a specific path designed for health verification checks; for example, /HealthCheck/{GUID}/ on the general access endpoint. This allows some functional tests within the application to be executed by the monitoring tools, such as adding a new user registration, signing in, and placing a test order, while also verifying that the general access endpoint is available.
* The type of information to collect in the service in response to monitoring requests, and how to return this information. Most existing tools and frameworks look only at the HTTP status code that the endpoint returns. To return and validate additional information it may be necessary to create a custom monitoring utility or service.
* How much information to collect. Performing excessive processing during the check may overload the application and impact other users, and the time it takes may exceed the timeout of the monitoring system so that it marks the application as unavailable. Most applications include instrumentation such as error handlers and performance counters that log performance and detailed error information, and this may be sufficient instead of returning additional information from a health verification check.
* How to configure security for the monitoring endpoints to protect them from public access; which might expose the application to malicious attacks, risk the exposure of sensitive information, or attract denial of service (DoS) attacks. Typically this should be done in the application configuration so that it can be updated easily without restarting the application. Consider using one or more of the following techniques:
  * Secure the endpoint by requiring authentication. This may be achieved by using an authentication security key in the request header or by passing credentials with the request, provided that the monitoring service or tool supports authentication.
  * Use an obscure or hidden endpoint. For example, expose the endpoint on a different IP address to that used by the default application URL, configure the endpoint on a non-standard HTTP port, and/or use a complex path to the test page. It is usually possible to specify additional endpoint addresses and ports in the application configuration, and add entries for these endpoints to the DNS server if required to avoid having to specify the IP address directly.
  * Expose a method on an endpoint that accepts a parameter such as a key value or an operation mode value. Depending on the value supplied for this parameter when a request is received the code can perform a specific test or set of tests, or return a 404 (Not Found) error if the parameter value is not recognized. The recognized parameter values could be set in the application configuration.

**Note:**
> DoS attacks are likely to have less impact on a separate endpoint that performs basic functional tests without compromising the operation of the application. Ideally, avoid using a test that might expose sensitive information. If you must return any information that might be useful to an attacker, consider how you will protect the endpoint and the data from unauthorized access. In this case just relying on obscurity is not sufficient. You should also consider using an HTTPS connection and encrypting any sensitive data, although this will increase the load on the server.

* How to access an endpoint that is secured using authentication. Not all tools and frameworks can be configured to include credentials with the health verification request. For example, Microsoft Azure built-in health verification features cannot provide authentication credentials. Some third party alternatives that can are Pingdom, Panopta, NewRelic, and Statuscake.
* How to ensure that the monitoring agent is performing correctly. One approach is to expose an endpoint that simply returns a value from the application configuration or a random value that can be used to test the agent.

**Note:**
> Also ensure that the monitoring system performs checks on itself, such as a self-test and built-in test, to avoid it issuing false positive results.

## 何时能用到这个模式
This pattern is ideally suited for:
* Monitoring websites and web applications to verify availability.
* Monitoring websites and web applications to check for correct operation.
* Monitoring middle-tier or shared services to detect and isolate a failure that could disrupt other applications.
* To complement existing instrumentation within the application, such as performance counters and error handlers. Health verification checking does not replace the requirement for logging and auditing in the application. Instrumentation can provide valuable information for an existing framework that monitors counters and error logs to detect failures or other issues. However, it cannot provide information if the application is unavailable.

## 实例（原文Ｃ#代码）
The following code examples, taken from the **HealthCheckController** class in the **HealthEndpointMonitoring.Web** project that is included in the samples you can download for this guide, demonstrates exposing an endpoint for performing a range of health checks.

The **CoreServices** method, shown below, performs a series of checks on services used in the application. If all of the tests execute without error, the method returns a 200 (OK) status code. If any of the tests raises an exception, the method returns a 500 (Internal Error) status code. The method could optionally return additional information when an error occurs, if the monitoring tool or framework is able to make use of it.
```csharp
public ActionResult CoreServices()
{
  try
  {
    // Run a simple check to ensure the database is available.
    DataStore.Instance.CoreHealthCheck();

    // Run a simple check on our external service.
    MyExternalService.Instance.CoreHealthCheck();
  }
  catch (Exception ex)
  {
    Trace.TraceError("Exception in basic health check: {0}", ex.Message);

    // This can optionally return different status codes based on the exception.
    // Optionally it could return more details about the exception.
    // The additional information could be used by administrators who access the
    // endpoint with a browser, or using a ping utility that can display the
    // additional information.
    return new HttpStatusCodeResult((int)HttpStatusCode.InternalServerError);
  }
  return new HttpStatusCodeResult((int)HttpStatusCode.OK);
}
```
The **ObscurePath** method shows how you can read a path from the application configuration and use it as the endpoint for tests. This example also shows how you can accept an ID as a parameter and use it to check for valid requests.
```csharp
public ActionResult ObscurePath(string id)
{
  // The id could be used as a simple way to obscure or hide the endpoint.
  // The id to match could be retrieved from configuration and, if matched, 
  // perform a specific set of tests and return the result. It not matched it
  // could return a 404 Not Found status.

  // The obscure path can be set through configuration in order to hide the endpoint.
  var hiddenPathKey = CloudConfigurationManager.GetSetting("Test.ObscurePath");

  // If the value passed does not match that in configuration, return 403 "Not Found".
  if (!string.Equals(id, hiddenPathKey))
  {
    return new HttpStatusCodeResult((int)HttpStatusCode.NotFound);
  }

  // Else continue and run the tests...
  // Return results from the core services test.
  return this.CoreServices();
}
```
The **TestResponseFromConfig** method shows how you can expose an endpoint that performs a check for a specified configuration setting value.
```csharp
public ActionResult TestResponseFromConfig()
{
  // Health check that returns a response code set in configuration for testing.
  var returnStatusCodeSetting = CloudConfigurationManager.GetSetting(
                                                          "Test.ReturnStatusCode");

  int returnStatusCode;

  if (!int.TryParse(returnStatusCodeSetting, out returnStatusCode))
  {
    returnStatusCode = (int)HttpStatusCode.OK;
  }

  return new HttpStatusCodeResult(returnStatusCode);
}
```

# Monitoring Endpoints in Azure Hosted Applications
Some options for monitoring endpoints in Azure applications are:
* Use the built-in features of Microsoft Azure, such as the Management Services or Traffic Manager.
* Use a third party service or a framework such as Microsoft System Center Operations Manager.
* Create a custom utility or a service that runs on your own or on a hosted server.

**Note:**
> Even though Azure provides a reasonably comprehensive set of monitoring options, you may decide to use additional services and tools to provide extra information.

Azure Management Services provides a comprehensive built-in monitoring mechanism built around alert rules. The Alerts section of the Management Services page in the Azure management portal allows you to configure up to ten alert rules per subscription for your services. These rules specify a condition and a threshold value for a service such as CPU load, or the number of requests or errors per second, and the service can automatically send email notifications to addresses you define in each rule.

The conditions you can monitor vary depending on the hosting mechanism you choose for your application (such as Web Sites, Cloud Services, Virtual Machines, or Mobile Services), but all of these include the capability to create an alert rule that uses a web endpoint you specify in the settings for your service. This endpoint should respond in a timely way so that the alert system can detect that the application is operating correctly.

**Note:**
> For more information about creating monitoring alerts, see [Management Services](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/dn306640.aspx) on MSDN.

If you host your application in Azure Cloud Services web and worker roles or Virtual Machines, you can take advantage of one of the built-in services in Azure called Traffic Manager. Traffic Manager is a routing and load-balancing service that can distribute requests to specific instances of your Cloud Services hosted application based on a range of rules and settings.

In addition to routing requests, Traffic Manager pings a URL, port, and relative path you specify on a regular basis to determine which instances of the application defined in its rules are active and are responding to requests. If it detects a status code 200 (OK) it marks the application as available, any other status code causes Traffic Manager to mark the application as offline. You can view the status in the Traffic Manager console, and configure the rule to reroute requests to other instances of the application that are responding.

However, keep in mind that Traffic Manager will only wait ten seconds to receive a response from the monitoring URL. Therefore, you should ensure that your health verification code executes within this timescale, allowing for network latency for the round trip from Traffic Manager to your application and back again.

**Note:**
> For more information about using Windows Traffic Manager to monitor your applications, see [Microsoft Azure Traffic Manager](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/hh745750.aspx) on MSDN. Traffic Manager is also discussed in [Multiple Datacenter Deployment Guidance](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn589779.aspx).

## 相关的设计模式和实践指南
The following guidance may also be relevant when implementing this pattern:
* [Instrumentation and Telemetry Guidance](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn589775.aspx). Checking the health of services and components is typically done by probing, but it is also useful to have the appropriate information in place to monitor application performance and detect events that occur at runtime. This data can be transmitted back to monitoring tools to provide an additional feature for health monitoring. The Instrumentation and Telemetry guidance explores the process of gathering remote diagnostics information that is collected by instrumentation in applications.
