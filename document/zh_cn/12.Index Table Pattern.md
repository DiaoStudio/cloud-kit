在数据存储中，可以对那些经常被查询条件所引用的字段创建索引。这种模式可以通过允许应用程序从数据存储中更快地定位和检索数据来提高查询效率。

## 现状及难题
许多数据存储对于一个实例集合使用主键来组织数据。一个应用程序可以使用这些键来定位和检索数据。图1展示了一个数据存储保存顾客信息的例子。这里的主键是顾客ID。

图1 - 通过主键（顾客ID）来组织顾客信息

一个主键对于那些根据这个键的值获取数据的请求是十分有价值的，但是一个应用程序需要通过其他字段来检索数据时，它可能就无法使用主键了。在这个顾客信息的例子中，一个应用程序若想单独通过其他属性作为检索条件来查询，它就无法使用顾客ID主键来检索顾客，比如使用顾客所在的城镇来查询。为了执行这样的一个查询，应用程序也许需要提取并检查所有的顾客记录，这可能就会是一个缓慢的过程。

许多关系型数据库系统支持二级索引（Secondary Index）。一个二级索引就是一个独立的由一个或多个非主键字段组织起来的数据结构，它显示了每一个被索引的值存储的地方。二级索引中的项一般都是通过从键（Secondary Key）中的值存储的，这能够使我们快速地检索数据。这些索引一般都由数据库管理系统自动维护。

为了支持你的应用程序执行的不同的请求，你可以根据需求尽可能多地创建二级索引。举个例子，在关系型数据库中的一个顾客表中，顾客ID是主键，当应用程序根据居住的城镇频繁检索顾客时，也许在城镇字段增加一个二级索引是一个不错的选择。

然而，虽然二级索引是关系型数据库的通用功能，但是大多数云应用程序使用的非关系型数据库并不支持一个相似的功能。

## 解决方案
If the data store does not support secondary indexes, you can emulate them manually by creating your own index tables. An index table organizes the data by a specified key. Three strategies are commonly used for structuring an index table, depending on the number of secondary indexes that are required and the nature of the queries that an application performs:

* Duplicate the data in each index table but organize it by different keys (complete denormalization). Figure 2 shows index tables that organize the same customer information by Town and LastName:  
![Figure 2 - Index tables implementing secondary indexes for customer data. The data is duplicated in each index table.](../files/en/12_Figure_2.png)  
Figure 2 - Index tables implementing secondary indexes for customer data. The data is duplicated in each index table.  
This strategy may be appropriate if the data is relatively static compared to the number of times it is queried by using each key. If the data is more dynamic, the processing overhead of maintaining each index table may become too great for this approach to be useful. Additionally, if the volume of data is very large, the amount of space required to store the duplicate data will be significant.

* Create normalized index tables organized by different keys and reference the original data by using the primary key rather than duplicating it, as shown in Figure 3. The original data is referred to as a fact table:  
![Figure 3 - Index tables implementing secondary indexes for customer data. The data is referenced by each index table.](../files/en/12_Figure_3.png)  
Figure 3 - Index tables implementing secondary indexes for customer data. The data is referenced by each index table.  
This technique saves space and reduces the overhead of maintaining duplicate data. The disadvantage is that an application has to perform two lookup operations to find data by using a secondary key (find the primary key for the data in the index table, and then look up the data in the fact table by using the primary key).

* Create partially normalized index tables organized by different keys that duplicate frequently retrieved fields. Reference the original data to access less frequently accessed fields. Figure 4 shows this structure.  
![Figure 4 - Index tables implementing secondary indexes for customer data. Commonly accessed data is duplicated in each index table.](../files/en/12_Figure_4.png)  
Figure 4 - Index tables implementing secondary indexes for customer data. Commonly accessed data is duplicated in each index table.  
Using this technique, you can strike a balance between the first two approaches. The data for common queries can be retrieved quickly by using a single lookup, while the space and maintenance overhead is not as great as duplicating the entire data set.

If an application frequently queries data by specifying a combination of values (for example, “Find all customers that live in Redmond and that have a last name of Smith”), you could implement the keys to the items in the index table as a concatenation of the Town attribute and the LastName attribute, as shown in Figure 5. The keys are sorted by Town, and then by LastName for records that have the same value for Town.  
![Figure 5 - An index table based on composite keys](../files/en/12_Figure_5.png)

Index tables can speed up query operations over sharded data, and are especially useful where the shard key is hashed. Figure 6 shows an example where the shard key is a hash of the Customer ID. The index table can organize data by the non-hashed value (Town and LastName), and provide the hashed shard key as the lookup data. This can save the application from repeatedly calculating hash keys (which may be an expensive operation) if it needs to retrieve data that falls within a range, or it needs to fetch data in order of the non-hashed key. For example, a query such as “Find all customers that live in Redmond” can be quickly resolved by locating the matching items in the index table (which are all stored in a contiguous block), and then following the references to the customer data by using the shard keys stored in the index table.

## 问题及注意事项
Consider the following points when deciding how to implement this pattern:

* The overhead of maintaining secondary indexes can be significant. You must analyze and understand the queries that your application uses. Only create index tables where they are likely to be used regularly. Do not create speculative index tables to support queries that an application does not perform, or that an application performs only very occasionally.
* Duplicating data in an index table can add a significant overhead in terms of storage costs and the effort required to maintain multiple copies of data.
* Implementing an index table as a normalized structure that references the original data may require an application to perform two lookup operations to find data. The first operation searches the index table to retrieve the primary key, and the second uses the primary key to fetch the data.
* If a system incorporates a number of index tables over very large data sets, it can be difficult to maintain consistency between index tables and the original data. It might be possible to design the application around the eventual consistency model. For example, to insert, update, or delete data, an application could post a message to a queue and let a separate task perform the operation and maintain the index tables that reference this data asynchronously. For more information about implementing eventual consistency, see the [Data Consistency primer](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn589800.aspx).

**Note:**

> Microsoft Azure storage tables support transactional updates for changes made to data held in the same partition (referred to as entity group transactions). If you can store the data for a fact table and one or more index tables in the same partition, you may be able to use this feature to help ensure consistency.

* Index tables may themselves be partitioned or sharded.

## 何时能用到这个模式
Use this pattern to improve query performance when an application frequently needs to retrieve data by using a key other than the primary (or shard) key.

This pattern might not be suitable when:

* Data is volatile. An index table may become out of date very quickly, rendering it ineffective or making the overhead of maintaining the index table greater than any savings made by using it.
* A field selected as the secondary key for an index table is very non-discriminating and can only have a small set of values (for example, gender).
* The balance of the data values for a field selected as the secondary key for an index table are highly skewed. For example, if 90% of the records contain the same value in a field, then creating and maintaining an index table to look up data based on this field may exert more overhead than scanning sequentially through the data. However, if queries very frequently target values that lie in the remaining 10%, this index may be useful. You must understand the queries that your application is performing, and how frequently they are performed.

## 实例
Azure storage tables provide a highly scalable key/value data store for applications running in the cloud. Applications store and retrieve data values by specifying a key. The data values can contain multiple fields, but the structure of a data item is opaque to table storage, which simply handles a data item as an array of bytes.

Azure storage tables also support sharding. The sharding key comprises two elements, a partition key and a row key. Items that have the same partition key are stored in the same partition (shard), and the items are stored in row key order within a shard. Table storage is optimized for performing range queries that fetch data falling within a contiguous range of row key values within a partition. If you are building cloud applications that store information in Azure tables, you should structure your data with this feature in mind.

For example, consider an application that stores information about movies. The application frequently queries movies by genre (Action, Documentary, Historical, Comedy, Drama, and so on). You could create an Azure table with partitions for each genre by using the genre as the partition key, and specifying the movie name as the row key, as shown in Figure 7.  
![Figure 7 - Movie data stored in an Azure Table, partitioned by genre and sorted by movie name](../files/en/12_Figure_7.png)  
Figure 7 - Movie data stored in an Azure Table, partitioned by genre and sorted by movie name

This approach is less effective if the application also needs to query movies by starring actor. In this case, you can create a separate Azure table that acts as an index table. The partition key is the actor and the row key is the movie name. The data for each actor will be stored in separate partitions. If a movie stars more than one actor, the same movie will occur in multiple partitions.

You can duplicate the movie data in the values held by each partition by adopting the first approach described in the Solution section above. However, it is likely that each movie will be replicated several times (once for each actor), so it may be more efficient to partially denormalize the data to support the most common queries (such as the names of the other actors) and enable an application to retrieve any remaining details by including the partition key necessary to find the complete information in the genre partitions. This approach is described by the third option in the Solution section. Figure 8 depicts this approach.

## 相关的设计模式和实践指南
The following patterns and guidance may also be relevant when implementing this pattern:

* [Data Consistency Primer](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn589800.aspx). An index table must be maintained as the data that it indexes changes. In the cloud, it may not be possible or appropriate to perform operations that update an index as part of the same transaction that modifies the data—an eventually consistent approach may be more suitable. This primer provides information on the issues surrounding eventual consistency.
* [Sharding Pattern](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn589797.aspx). The Index Table pattern is frequently used in conjunction with data partitioned by using shards. The Sharding pattern provides more information on how to divide a data store into a set of shards.
* [Materialized View Pattern](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn589782.aspx). Instead of indexing data to support queries that summarize data, it may be more appropriate to create a materialized view of the data. This pattern describes how to support efficient summary queries by generating pre-populated views over data.
