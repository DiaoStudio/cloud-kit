# diao-utils

v0.1

## Introduction
This is a utils library of cloud design patterns inspired by the idea behind [microsoft's paper](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn568099.aspx) about cloud design patterns.  
We will translate all paper to simplified Chinese and try to achieve each pattern to pick up them into a library for other users.  
We believe that technology will change the world, and we love cloud :)

You can find the paper in `document` fold with each language, and find util library in `utils` folder.
